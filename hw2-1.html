	<h1> FUN THINGS I'VE DISCOVERED ON THE INTERNET THAT ARE KEEPING ME AWAKE </h1>
		<h3>And can now keep you awake too.</h3>

		<p>Some late evening this past week, I stumbled across an article called <a href="http://nautil.us/issue/9/time/life-is-a-braid-in-spacetime">Life is a Braid in Spacetime</a> (on Tumblr, if I had to hazard a guess). Understanding absolutely nothing about theoretical physics, I was immediately impressed by the article's MIT-professor author, Max Tegmark (who is also known in scientific communities as "Mad Max", just FYI). Max's main claim to fame is his Mathematical Universe Hypothesis -- in his words: "I argue that not only spacetime, but indeed our entire external physical reality, is a mathematical structure, which is by definition an abstract, immutable entity existing outside of space and time." In this particular article, Max attempts to reconcile this view with a messier, less reducible part of universe -- life. To do this, Max imagines each elementary particle of a living being as a thread through spacetime (this is where he gets the imagery of the braid -- see below). </p>

	</center>

		<p>If the image does not settle all your questions, Max offers this rather pithy summary: You’re a pattern in spacetime. </p>

		<p>I <em>am</em> rather charmed by the suggestion, but I have more questions than ever.</p>

		<p>WHO IS MAX? Can we trust him on a matter this important? Splendid questions, reader. I, too, have no way of gauging the goodness of theoretical physicists. I have to rely on poorly sampled metadata. Take, for example, this <a href="http://www.math.columbia.edu/~woit/wordpress/?p=6551">post</a> on the blog, <em>Not Even Wrong</em>. It's rather scathing. Peter Wolt (blog post author) seems to question Max's membership in the the scientific community, and I can't help but feel that perhaps he does too far in making those suggestions about Max's relationship with his father. BUT THEN, BUT THEN: <a href="http://www.huffingtonpost.com/stephen-hawking/artificial-intelligence_b_5174265.html">here</a> is Max co-authoring a blog post about risk (mis)management in AI research (and the resulting threats to humanity, if singularity is reached) with <strong>STEPHEN FREAKING HAWKING</strong> (and others). In the Huffington Post. In anticipation of the weekend debut of the then fun, new Johnny Depp movie, <em>Transcendence</em>. Do you think they collaborated on a draft by Google Drive? Did one of them write it, and the others just okayed it? Did Stephen Hawking Google Max before agreeing to work with him? Is this a rare collaboration amongst foes or fun side project for friends??</p>

		<p>It's worth noting that Max is one of the co-founders of the <a href="http://fqxi.org/">Foundational Questions Institute</a> and <a href="http://futureoflife.org/">the Future of Life Institute</a> (which is working with Elon Musk to fund research to keep AI "beneficial"). I don't know what this could possibly mean for Max as a physicist, but hey, the man's got street cred. Max also wrote a paper in 2014 called, "Consciousness as a State of Matter" (read more <a href="http://arxiv.org/abs/1401.1219">here</a>). That deserves repeating: <em>CONSCIOUSNESS</em> as a state of <em>MATTER</em>.</p> The abstract uses the word "eigenbasis", so someone else will have to explain the full meaning of this work to me.</p>

		<p>Okay, and he made fun of himself on Facebook. Well, technical Saturday Morning Breakfast made fun of him first and he posted <a href="http://www.smbc-comics.com/index.php?id=3805">it</a>. </p>

		<p>Maybe Max is pretty okay.</p> 

		<p>Did my internet journey end there, you may be wondering (and possibly wishing). <strong>NO.</strong> It turns out that the <a href="http://nautil.us/">magazine</a> that posted Max's "Life is a Braid..." article is FULL of clickbait for Rashida. A sampling of their other work:</p>

		<p>It's a freakin' goldmine. You could easily lose weeks (or the better part of a morning) in there. Is the content actually robust scientific journalism? I don't know that I care anymore.</p>

		<p>P.S. Several <a href="https://ksj.mit.edu/tracker/2013/06/does-science-magazine-nautilus-have-agen/">sites</a> (including the good ol' <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/science/a-glossy-science-magazine-or-living-fossil.html?_r=0">NYTimes</a>) have pointed out that Nautilus received funding from the John Templeton Foundation, an organization viewed by some as having a religious agenda. Um, I'll just leave that thought here.</p>

		<p>P.P.S. I went back into my internet history to try to find the post that started this all. Here's the quote that triggered this madness: <strong>"Imagine all the food you have eaten in your life and consider that you are simply some of that food, rearranged."</strong></p>

		<h3>ANOTHER ITEM OF CRITICAL IMPORTANCE</h3>
